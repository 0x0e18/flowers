# Flowers

Create a simple, heartfelt website for a loved one with an animation including flowers and hearts, along with messages you can leave. The design includes navigation arrows that let the user click through past messages.

The animation data is derived from text found in the data folder. You can change this data to any song or text of your choice.

This tutorial should be very beginner friendly, but if you encounter issues you can either dm me on Twitter at @wgm_v or use ChatGPT to help walk you through it.

## Features

- Display messages for your loved ones.
- Navigate between different messages using arrows.
- Flower and heart animations based on text data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is helpful but not necessary.
- A text editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, or even Notepad). I used VSCode.
- A hosting service for your website, like GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc. I used Cloudflare.
- If you'd like, a custom domain name - this will add a little bit of complexity though. I purchased one via Godaddy.

    Replace `main` with the name of your branch if it's different.

## Customization

## File Overview

### index.html
This file contains the structure of your webpage. It includes the messages and references to other files like `styles.css` and `script.js`. To change the visible content of the website, you'll edit this file.

### styles.css
This file contains all the styling rules for your website. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness. Beginners may not need to edit this file, but if you're comfortable with CSS, feel free to make changes to suit your design preferences.

### script.js
This file contains the logic for animations and interactivity. It handles the creation of flower and heart animations, the navigation buttons, and the display of messages. This is where the magic happens, and advanced users can modify this to change how the animations work.

### data Folder
This folder contains the text files used to generate the animations. You can replace these files with your own text, such as song lyrics, poems, or personal messages. Just make sure the filenames match those referenced in `script.js`.

## Deployment

To make your website live, you can use services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Hereâ€™s a simple guide using GitHub Pages:

1. Push your changes to GitHub.
2. Go to your repository on GitHub.
3. Click on the `Settings` tab.
4. Scroll down to the `GitHub Pages` section.
5. Under `Source`, select `main` branch and click `Save`.
